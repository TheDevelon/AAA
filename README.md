# AAA
Repo of AntiAuraAddon (updated version with source code)

First of all: My code is bad, I am only doing this as an hobby and my experience is slowly growing.
I hope this project will improve to a state I can tell myself I am satisfied with my code.

I am already doing my best to keep the impact of AAA low on your server.


Gonna update the wiki and issues soon.

Now I am able to commit code directly from IntelliJ.
If you have code improvements for me (and I am certain some of you have), msg me on Discord or Spigot.

Thx.
